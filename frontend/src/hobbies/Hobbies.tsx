              I'm a B.S Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota with an interest in 
              Quantum Computing and Operating Systems, with an intention to begin and continue
              research in these subjects beyond my collegiate years.
              <br/><br/>
              Outside of school, I am an avid sweater collector, and my pants cost me way too much.
              I like playing Dungeons & Dragons and have been playing with my group for about 5 years.
              My entire wallet has been emptied on Warhammer 40k miniatures and paint :((
