            I am known as the 
            Socrates of our generation, except I don't know philosophy, but I know computers. 
            Don't ask who calls me this, though, please just trust that many people are saying this. <br/>

            I'm a B.S Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota with an interest in 
            Quantum Computing and Operating Systems, with an intention to begin and continue
            research in these subjects beyond my collegiate years.

            Outside of school, I am an avid sweater collector, and my pants cost me way too much.
            I like playing Dungeons & Dragons and have been playing with my group for about 5 years.
            My entire wallet has been emptied on Warhammer 40k miniatures and paint :((
